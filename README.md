getmed
======

Get media from external devices, automatized and CLI.

## Motivation for writing `getmed`

#### The tool-oriented reasons
* Getting a nice to use CLI tool for transferring images/videos from media-devices.
  * Getting useful realtime CLI output about the transfer-progress.
  * Automated handling of already defined devices.
  * A safe way to transfer files - no overwriting - no deletion of
  un-transferred files.
  * A practical way to sort media-files into seperate destination-dirs.

#### The other reasons
* Testing new functional design-patterns in OCaml.
* Testbed for bigger future programs.
* Experience with interfacing with the unix-system from OCaml.
  * Testing OCaml as a better alternative to bash-scripting.

*More documentation on the way.*
